# SDK-GO POST-First Upload - Implementation Report

**ClickUp Task:** `86e00pauy`  
**Subagent:** SDK-GO Agent  
**Date:** 2026-02-23  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

Successfully implemented POST-first upload flow to fix race condition in DME SDK-GO producer.

---

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. **Refactored `UploadDataset()` Method**
   - **Old flow:** Encrypt → Upload to S3 → POST to API
   - **New flow:** POST to API → Get presigned URL → Encrypt → PUT to presigned URL
   - **Result:** Catalog record exists BEFORE upload (no race condition)

### 2. **Added 3 New Methods**
   ```go
   createDatasetRecord()    // Step 1: POST to API, get presigned URL
   processFile()            // Step 2: Compress + encrypt file
   uploadToPresignedURL()   // Step 3: PUT to presigned URL
   ```

### 3. **Created 2 New Types**
   ```go
   CreateDatasetResponse    // API response: {id, upload_url, s3_key}
   ProcessedFileData        // Processed file: {data, sizes, analysis}
   ```

### 4. **Added Comprehensive Tests**
   - 10 new test cases in `upload_post_first_test.go`
   - All tests pass ✅
   - Coverage: validation, presigned URL upload, error handling

---

## 📊 Test Results

```bash
$ cd ~/Dev/thalesfsp/dme/sdk/go && go test ./...
ok  	github.com/helix-tools/sdk-go/api	    (cached)
ok  	github.com/helix-tools/sdk-go/consumer	(cached)
ok  	github.com/helix-tools/sdk-go/producer	0.288s
```

**All tests pass** ✅  
**Build successful** ✅

### New Tests Added:
- ✅ TestProcessFileCompression
- ✅ TestProcessFileEmptyFile
- ✅ TestProcessFileMissingFile
- ✅ TestUploadToPresignedURL/successful_upload
- ✅ TestUploadToPresignedURL/upload_failure_-_403_Forbidden
- ✅ TestUploadToPresignedURL/empty_data
- ✅ TestUploadDatasetValidation (3 subtests)
- ✅ TestCreateDatasetResponseStructure

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes / Requirements

### **API Changes Required**

The implementation **requires** the backend API to support:

```http
POST /v1/datasets
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "dataset-name",
  "description": "...",
  "category": "general",
  "data_freshness": "daily",
  "producer_id": "customer-id",
  "metadata": {...}
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "dataset-123",
  "upload_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/key?X-Amz-Signature=...",
  "s3_key": "datasets/dataset-name/data.ndjson.gz"
}
```

### **Key Changes:**
1. API must generate presigned URL on POST
2. API should NOT require `s3_key` or `size_bytes` in initial POST
3. Presigned URL should have appropriate expiration (e.g., 15 minutes)

---

## 🎁 Benefits

✅ **Eliminates race condition** - Dataset record exists before file upload  
✅ **Better error handling** - Dataset ID known even if upload fails  
✅ **Improved security** - Presigned URL = time-limited, scoped access  
✅ **Simpler SDK** - No S3 client needed for uploads  
✅ **Atomic operations** - Clear separation of concerns  
✅ **Idempotency ready** - API can enforce duplicate checks at POST time  

---

## 📂 Deliverables

1. ✅ Updated `producer.go` with new POST-first flow
2. ✅ Comprehensive test suite (`upload_post_first_test.go`)
3. ✅ Documentation (`UPLOAD_FLOW_CHANGES.md`)
4. ✅ All existing tests still pass
5. ✅ Code builds successfully

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

### For API Team:
1. Implement presigned URL generation in `POST /v1/datasets`
2. Update response structure to include `upload_url`
3. Deploy API changes
4. Update API documentation

### For SDK Team:
1. ✅ SDK changes complete (this task)
2. Integration testing with updated API (once deployed)
3. Update SDK documentation
4. Release new SDK version

---

## 📌 Summary

The SDK-GO producer now follows a **POST-first upload flow** that prevents race conditions by:
1. Creating the dataset record FIRST (via POST)
2. Getting a presigned URL from the API
3. Uploading the encrypted/compressed file to that URL
4. Fetching the final dataset record

**Status:** Implementation complete. Waiting on API changes.
